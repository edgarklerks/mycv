# My CV #

This repository holds my CV. It is made in latex. After losing my previous one, I decided to make the source of my cv opensource, so I can push it to github and never lose it again.

I use the excellent moderncv package together with some modifications. One of the interesting features is a table with languages I know.

I would like to have a table of contents for webview.

# TODO

Unfortunately I cannot use pandoc to change it to other formats, due to the use of tabularx  and tcolortable.

# INSTALL

	pdflatex  cv.latex
	pdflatex  cv.latex

# Download precompiled one
